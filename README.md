# Simple-ML-Chatbot

Project Name:Simple-ML-Chatbot named as Jarvis

Description:
Jarvis is an intelligent conversational agent developed using PyTorch and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. It is designed to handle various user queries and provide contextually relevant responses. The chatbot utilizes a machine learning-based approach, specifically a feedforward neural network trained on a dataset of intents. Natural language processing techniques such as tokenization, bag-of-words representation, and softmax activation are employed to understand user inputs and generate appropriate responses.

Key Features:
- Utilizes PyTorch for building and training the neural network model.
- Implements natural language processing techniques including tokenization and bag-of-words representation.
- Incorporates a feedforward neural network architecture for intent classification.
- Provides dynamic responses based on user queries and context.

Technologies Used:
- Programming Languages:Python
- Libraries:PyTorch, NLTK, NumPy
- Concepts: Natural Language Processing (NLP), Feedforward Neural Networks, Machine Learning

Skills Demonstrated:
- Data preprocessing
- Model training and optimization
- Deployment of machine learning models

Usage:
Users can interact with the SmartChatBot by entering text inputs and receiving contextually relevant responses. The chatbot's capabilities include handling greetings, weather inquiries, discussing hobbies, and providing general assistance.

Future Enhancements:
- Integration of more advanced NLP techniques for improved understanding and response generation.
- Incorporation of additional features such as sentiment analysis and entity recognition.
- Deployment of the chatbot in various platforms and applications for real-world usage.
